# WPRB Playlists

Web scraper to gather data from wprb.com. Intent is to learn Django, JavaScript and various music library API's by building a site with better functionality than the existing one.

* scraper.py is a collection of Python modules that can be used to import data from http://www.wprb.com

* queries.sql is a collection of sample queries for the playlist database

* blank_db_schema.sqlite3 is an empty database generated by Django with current models. So far have had no luck uploading a full database to GitHub due to size despite GitHub's LFS tool. For now, use Dropbox or BitBucket to distribute full database:
